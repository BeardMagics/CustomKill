# CustomKill
Custom killfeed utilizing existing foundations, developed for Blood Wars server (forked source from Sunrise, utilizing some logic and functioning from Phlebotomist (Morphine) as well)

Current working features are:

*******STAT TRACKING********

Users can query stats using the .stats command, or alternatively .stats playerName (i.e. .stats Bruno) to display their own stats, or the stats of other players.

*******TOP COMMAND********

Similar to other kill feeds, implementation of .top [category] - with categories currently as Kills, Deaths, Assists, MaxStreak
Displays the top 5 in their respective categories (Assists may be broken currently)

Features the .pi (player inspect) from Sunrises' killfeed mod - .pi playerName will query their clan name level and clanmates.

Level gap system remains in tact as in Sunrises' kf mod and values can be set to determine minimum acceptable and max acceptable level gap.

All source code utilized in this mod is direct iterations from Deca (OG creator), Morphine, and Sunrise - All credits go to them as original authors. I do not own but a small fraction of the source contained within this mod.

This mod uses the MIT license similar to most modding. You are free to distribute and change anything contained within, so long as that distribution is not released upon receiving monitization. Please ensure to credit the original authors in your works.
